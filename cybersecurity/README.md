## Introduction to Active Directory
Active Directory (AD) is the **core identity and access management system** in most enterprise networks. Because it controls **authentication, authorization, and security policies**, it is a prime target for attackers.

### üîπ Why is AD critical for cybersecurity?
- **A compromised AD = Full network control.**
- Attackers use AD misconfigurations to escalate privileges.
- AD attacks like **Pass-the-Hash, Kerberoasting, and Golden Ticket** are commonly exploited in real-world breaches.

## Active Directory Structure & Security Risks
AD consists of **logical** and **physical** components, each with potential security risks.

### üîπ **Logical Structure & Attack Surfaces**
- **Forest & Domains** ‚Üí A compromise at the **forest root** can impact all domains.
- **Organizational Units (OUs)** ‚Üí Poor access control on OUs can lead to unauthorized GPO modifications.
- **Objects (Users, Groups, Computers, GPOs, etc.)** ‚Üí Overprivileged accounts increase attack surface.

### üîπ **Physical Structure Risks**
- **Domain Controllers (DCs)** ‚Üí If an attacker gains access to a DC, they own the network.
- **Replication & Trusts** ‚Üí Attackers abuse replication (DCShadow attack) to inject fake domain controllers.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Risks in AD Design**
1. **Excessive Admin Privileges** ‚Üí Attackers escalate privileges easily.
2. **Weak Password Policies** ‚Üí Enables brute-force and credential-stuffing attacks.
3. **Unrestricted Kerberos Delegation** ‚Üí Leads to Kerberoasting & ticket attacks.
4. **Unmonitored Service Accounts** ‚Üí Often have excessive permissions and weak passwords.

## Authentication Protocols & Weaknesses
AD primarily uses **Kerberos** and **NTLM** for authentication, both of which have known vulnerabilities.

### üîπ **Kerberos Authentication & Attacks**
- Uses **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)** & **TGS (Service Tickets)** for authentication.
- **Golden Ticket Attack** ‚Üí Attackers forge TGTs to gain indefinite domain access.
- **Kerberoasting** ‚Üí Extracts **service account** hashes for offline cracking.

### üîπ **NTLM Authentication (Legacy & Insecure)**
- Susceptible to **Pass-the-Hash (PTH)** and **NTLM Relay Attacks**.
- Does **not use encryption**, making it easy to capture and replay credentials.
- **Mitigation**: Disable NTLM when possible and enforce **Kerberos-only authentication**.

## AD Hardening & Security Best Practices
### üîπ **Group Policy & Access Control Hardening**
- **Enforce the principle of least privilege** (POLP).
- Restrict **who can modify Group Policies (GPOs)**.
- Disable **unnecessary features like LLMNR and Ne
